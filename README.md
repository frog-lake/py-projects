## py-projects
A small repo containing a series of small python programs

So far, these programs have been adapted from <a href=https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html>here.</a> Specific chapters will be referred to in the code itself.

The plan is to eventually branch out and add more little projects to this repo, but who knows if that will happen ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
